# Mohawk Reef Temperature
Visualization of Mohawk Reef (SBC LTER study site) bottom seawater temperature over time (basic visualization, heatwaveR, warming stripes, and temperature animation of coastline)
## Creator
Sophia is a research technician at UC Santa Barbara, utilizing the NCEAS coreR Course catalog to format the repository. 

## Data
- The dataset is [bottom seawater temperature](https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/c2c3f2e27aac1cae2a213ebbfdb85e25) from various [Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research Group](https://sbclter.msi.ucsb.edu/) study sites to visualize the change in seawater temperatures spanning from 2000 - 2025.
- Raw data (546.7 MB) not tracked in GitHub. Download from the link located in the source tab (package version 32)
